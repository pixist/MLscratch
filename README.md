INTRODUCTION
------------
This project consists of one encoder and two classifier algorithms:
 * Q1. PCA & Eigenfaces
 * Q2. Logistic Regression
 * Q3. Support Vector Machine (SVMs)
Comments in the notebooks can be followed to find the required outputs.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
This project requires the following libraries:

 * [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
 * [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
 * [PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
 * [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)

Data files are required for programs to work. For this code to work as it is,
Both training and test files must be in the same directory with the extensionless
files with names such as "Your ... Files Here".


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Programs are written as Jupyter notebooks. You can run the codes with notebook of your choice
such as VSCode or Jupyter Notebook. Comments are provided for code snippets.

Q1 can be configured in terms of data folder name and desired resolution.
